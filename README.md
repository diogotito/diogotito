TODO a little blurb about me
and (maybe):

  - [ ] [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) extra pins
  - [ ] [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) pinned gists
  - [ ] links to a few GitLab repos (esp. the learning-opengl one)
  - [ ] fancy GitHub Action that reads my side-projects Trello board, takes cards that have links to publicly hosted repos from three lists and writes an SVG diagram for this profile's README section

CONSIDER what belongs to my GitHub profile and what belongs to my personal homepage?
